## About
I am a 4th-year undergraduate student at [School of Electrical Engineering](https://ee.kaist.ac.kr/?language=en) (with a minor degree in [Computer Science](https://cs.kaist.ac.kr/)) at [Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/html/en/). During my bachelor's degree, I had several interests at the time, from computer architecture, deep learning accelerators, CUDA programming, to control systems. After that, I was exposed to robotics and computer vision, which, for whatever reason, I was very intrigued and motivated by it.

I am interested in SLAM, visual-inertial navigation, 3D computer vision, and deep learning with its applications in robotics.
